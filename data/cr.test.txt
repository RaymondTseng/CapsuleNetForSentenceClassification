so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .	1
original review december 2004 i'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their zen micro , but mine has worked great ! .	1
the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to get to .	1
the hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately .	0
the great and versatile ipod	1
the ipod package comes with everything you need , the ac adaptor , firewire cable ( quicker than usb , but slower than usb 2 which it also gives ) , those snazzy and power full headphones , and of course the player .	1
it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great .	1
i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience .	0
i could take 1/2 " passes and it still didn't skip a beat .	1
i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .	1
this is a great camera for you ! .	1
4 ) the camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away .	0
i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .	1
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .	1
the micro seemed like an ipod for less .	1
it barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzes all over the player , because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart .	0
the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .	0
we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd500 .	1
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes ! .	0
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .	1
i thought the software was decent enough - it wasn't complicated to learn at all .	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .	0
i am an it professional and have used norton for years , but this product is a complete and utter dud .	0
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; . an exceptional close-up shooting capability .	1
it was easy to assemble , and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion .	1
sometimes , it needs few minutes to open an application .	0
it is an extremely cool cozmo .	1
you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .	1
i 've been incredibly happy with this camera .	1
if you are using linux , and you want to use gprs to connect to the net , i suggest this phone along with a belkin usb bluetooth adapter .	1
proven canon built quality and lens .	1
the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog .	1
solid food poop is very stinky and this diaper pail doesn't really contain the smell .	0
also included in the " games " section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs .	1
am so glad i bought this camera .	1
this one has a color display , which i like a lot , being very visual .	1
-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ) .	0
i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be	1
creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can't understand why eax would introduce static .	0
as opposed to the nomad ii or any other flash based player , the songs load extremely fast . . . about one or two seconds per song .	1
this is a great product , and canon has done an excellent job .	1
the headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of " ear buds " .	0
i love the storage in this thing .	1
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .	1
and it is extremely well-priced for what you 're getting .	1
i can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than motorola's do , but as long as i'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine .	1
i really dislike holding a phone to my ear , and i 've found the free speak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone .	1
compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .	1
here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .	1
n6600 supports midi , wav , arm , mp3 etc .	1
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .	1
good looks	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to maneuver through the menus quickly .	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took ! .	1
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .	1
another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera .	1
the songs don't play one after another like on a cd .	0
the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .	1
getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .	0
also , the lens cap design is flawed .	0
the picture is perfect , although i'm not watching on an hdtv .	1
i like it 's shape and it 's keypad and joystick .	1
the best thing to do with this version , is to leave it on the store shelf . it doesn't work , and will cost you an enormous amount of your time , not to mention your hard earned dollars .	0
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod .	1
scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .	1
i 've had this player for more than 4 months and i'm very happy with it .	1
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .	0
its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .	1
our norton internet/av 2004 was terrible right from the get go , so i 'd think that if steelworks is ok now , it should remain ok .	0
the general button placement is not very user friendly .	0
the white-led backlit lcd is very bright and crisp , even in sunlight , and relatively easy on the battery .	1
the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .	1
the plug er gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess .	0
unfortunately , the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it .	0
as i mentioned in my first paragraph , it supports wpa security , which is far superior to wep .	1
i'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies ( such a samsung and motorola ) it might be good . . . . but if you 're getting a nokia , don't get this one .	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .	0
the dvd player just would 't recognize them .	0
it is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags , easy to clean , and most important , easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle .	1
the radio and voice recording are nice .	1
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .	0
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .	1
the earbuds are great headphones as good as my ak studio 240 , well not as good but darn close .	1
the setup was a breeze , i had some reservations about a wireless network ( see my review for linksys wet11 ) but this item was on sale as well as the wet11 so i just had to splurge .	1
what this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for different operating systems ! .	0
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! .	0
this setup using the cd was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time .	1
you can " disable " some of the individual components , but don't be fooled -- they 're still there and running .	0
i am now staring at an array of stuff including zen micro player , stereo earbud headphones , a rechargeable lithium-ion battery , an ac/dc power adapter , a usb 2 . 0 cable , a belt-clip , a stand , a stylish cloth pouch , an installation cd , a quick-start guide , and creative mediasource software .	1
it hasn't gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ) .	1
it constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like walls in our house block the link so everything is very slow .	0
apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .	1
i like some local stations , stern , and npr , and so the radio seemed like a great option .	1
along the way we compared it to my wife 's t720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life , connectivity bars and features .	1
the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .	0
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .	1
to use the creative zen player with a subscription service , you need to go to creative 's web site , and download new software for your pc .	0
well , it was nice while it lasted .	1
creative labs customer support website is useless .	0
best of all the wmas ( i have a lot of them ) sound great .	1
- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price	1
8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .	1
i 'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera .	1
the phone can use any midi audio file as a ringtone .	1
and so far , i 've been very pleased .	1
when talking the voice is not very clear .	0
i prefer things that are simple .	1
the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .	0
a lot of " fragments " were left in the registry , and it the norton system folders .	0
i really love this phone . . .	1
it gives you the most bang for your buck , period .	1
unfortunately it can't play all of the dvd .	0
since i use it in a table , i don't use the plunge feature , but if i ever need it i 've got it .	1
that 's a rare and valuable feature .	1
broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies .	1
after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .	0
it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .	1
i love that you can create custom playlists , and organize music in so many different ways .	1
my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .	1
once again it won't reinstall , even with online and email assistance from symantect technicians .	0
this phone is highly recommended otherwise .	1
after repeal cleaning and re cleaning , it still stuck after using it for a little while .	0
i would recommend this camera unequivocally ! .	1
again , every review written about the tech line is true . . . after waiting close to 45 minutes i finally spoke to a rep .	0
ball metaphor : i was hoping creative hit a home run here , and i think the zen micro is more like a stand-up double .	1
this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another .	1
downside is the size of the phone , it is big for today 's standard .	0
the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .	1
but that is good for me because symantec soft wares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers .	1
it contains the smell from our baby 's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside .	1
i highly recommend it .	1
and the remote is cheap and ch easy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck ! .	0
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; . shutter delay isn't so bad either .	1
not plug & play ; . relies on id3 ; . no fm or recording	0
goes ~3 days after a charge .	1
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .	1
also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra knobs or gizmo's .	1
the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .	1
when you learn how to change some settings , you can make the quality even better	1
also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4 . 99 / mo . ) never works .	0
working for 10 hours with it on " shuffle " totally rocks ! . ! .	1
i gave up and got a diaper decor .	0
it 's easy and really works , with some incredible range .	1
fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket .	1
update ( march 2005 ) : my son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now , but the diaper champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use , no problems with odors , and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby : - )	1
no line out jack - as i said , there is none .	0
i purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the ct people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed .	1
compared to other leading dd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .	1
i would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature .	0
they obviously have quality and reliability problems .	0
then sorting the files is easy as pie .	1
i got a 1gb mmc upgrade for this phone and now i can :	1
for the price and size and features , you can't beat the price .	1
i think this is it 's biggest flaw .	0
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .	1
this makes for a great phone .	1
the stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk .	1
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .	0
now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .	0
when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply weren't there :	0
you must keep double checking depths .	0
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .	1
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .	1
creative media source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it , and the file transfers are fast .	1
the power is incredible , it cut through md and plywood like butter .	1
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .	0
this product is way cooler than anything ive used before ( pencilings and maccabees and norton antivirus alone ) .	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .	1
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .	0
great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! . ! . ! .	1
i would however highly recommend the m12v router ! .	1
i 've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far , and i 've not to get either product working properly .	0
then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not .	0
it is crystal clear .	1
better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility .	1
1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .	0
if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket , take great pics and video , get the sd500 .	1
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .	1
as i said , i don't regret the purchase at all .	1
it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .	1
they look fantastic .	1
while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with " alerts " every twenty seconds ( literally ) , warning me my antivirus protection was off .	0
the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .	0
this wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer ( with photo quality paper ) .	1
a sony erickson may be the phone for you . . . but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price .	1
es , the interface took a little getting used to , but once i did , it 's almost second nature now .	0
they say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact .	1
the battery life is less than stellar , but it charges w/ the quickness .	1
i purchased the elph s100 mainly because i thought it was cool .	1
it really is the perfect travel camera , plus it offers the convenience of digital photography .	1
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .	0
still has terrible software .	0
its well made and user friendly .	1
don't use them , so i delete them for addle space .	0
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .	1
so far the software for the pc works easily .	1
no smell , easy to use with one hand free , and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are impossible to find ! .	1
it 's also easy to empty out .	1
fm radio built in ( howard stern ) .	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .	1
the voice recorder is a beautiful add-on ; . not even necessary , but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player .	1
namely , it wouldnt sync .	0
the display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary .	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well re cored mp3s .	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .	1
it fits in your pocket .	1
for one thing , the diapers always get jammed in it .	0
it holds almost a week 's worth of diapers , and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work .	1
i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .	1
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .	1
output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .	0
the accessories that come with the player are great .	1
most of us just want to plug and play , not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options . . . like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing .	0
on my main computer the software did not work right .	0
it 's not my first choice in cameras ,	0
this way i never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones , i can get whatever i want .	1
only con i can think of is no camera . . . .	0
the reception and sound quality are top-notch .	1
this is the fourth version of systemworks and the second version of internet security that i have used and it has always been a favorite .	1
a call to customer support ( got to a live person within a couple of minutes ) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance .	1
good image quality .	1
i'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no vi sable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .	1
i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .	0
it also holds a lot more diapers .	1
this dvd play is basically junk .	0
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .	1
pros : - excellent sound , even with the headphones that come out of the box , but it absolutely rocked with my bose quiet comfort 2 set .	1
the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone " unlike the nokia 3650 " and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make . . .	1
a very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years .	1
you won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks .	1
the blue backlight is pretty cool .	1
it has never worked .	0
b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display	0
overall though , i'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player , even if it is to pretend your not a brain dead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod . ; . )	1
and man . . . i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player . . . because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title . .	0
this phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones .	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .	0
and so far , i have been very , very happy with my zen micro .	1
the sd500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed .	1
5- excelent software package .	1
b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens ti gt and cause potential damage .	0
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i'm not too keen on www . ipod's dirty secret . com .	1
also , the instruction manual is very bad .	0
it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .	0
all in all , not very good .	0
stay away from this junk .	0
the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .	1
a huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it .	1
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .	1
i forgot , the case doesn't fit .	0
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .	1
the software with the ipod includes itunes , which allows you to play the music on your computer , rip cds onto your computer , and move your music from the computer to the ipod .	1
i have stored 40 audio cds and i still have close to 2 . 8 gb free .	1
the song quality of the ipod is excellent , and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory , for most users .	1
two : it has a removeable/rechargeable battery , so you don't have to send the thing in when the re ! .	1
and if you 're a mac user like me , they 've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative .	0
5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .	0
i still give the ipod five stars , though , as it could have been something i did incorrectly during the install ( though i did follow the onscreen prompts ) so i 'll give apple the benefit of the doubt .	1
gets stinky after a few months , the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore .	0
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .	1
i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful .	0
if you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive , i 'd re comment buying it to try out , and also buy an extra 2 year warranty for it ( there are some offered here , for about $15 dollars i think ) .	1
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .	0
with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .	1
creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and , yes , charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie .	1
6- small but very clear tft screen .	1
the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .	1
in fact , it supports the new wpa encryption standard , which is way better than wep .	1
finally , i gave up and i purchased a router racier .	0
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .	1
this thing seriously is a good player though .	1
but the product is elf is great .	1
the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .	0
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .	1
also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and br mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .	1
but this by far is the best phone out there right now ! .	1
this is my first digital camera and i couldn't be happier .	1
the software failed repeatedly .	0
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .	0
this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard .	1
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ah wile .	0
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! .	1
- included creative software is pretty poor .	0
4 . the build is just right .	1
its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus .	1
you just can't go wrong with this one ! .	1
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ; .	1
at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .	1
new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .	0
i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data .	0
also , multiple picture feature is very , very fast .	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .	1
i 'll be getting a second one for my router table ! .	1
i have no problems with the touch pad ( once the sensitivity is set to low ) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual .	1
i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .	0
downloads are a snap and quick .	1
it also works just fine for international calls .	1
my first impression was positive .	1
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .	1
i originally gave this camera 5 stars . when i had windows 98 it was wonderful but i got a new computer last november with xp the usb software is soho . . . not compatible with xp	0
if the plunging action is critical to your work , look elsewhere .	0
unlike other reviewers , i like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table .	1
some features that the 'zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include : a 5g hard drive . . . actually an sd flash card drive . . . very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook 's calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs .	1
i love this camera .	1
for the price and features it is really good .	1
for the price i don't think you can beat it .	1
for the price it is a well spent investment ! .	1
this camera is closest to perfect than any other diagram that is 4-5 megapixel .	1
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .	0
loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .	0
i recently had to run a 3/4 " straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn't even slow down .	1
i dont especially like how music files are unstructured ; . basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization , like you might have in windows explorer folders and sub folders .	0
if you don't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .	0
on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .	1
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .	1
however , i suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- do not purchase this product .	0
if you use linux and want gr ps and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device , and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you .	1
i have never had this problem with any other software on my computer .	0
it 's easy to install the security on this product but linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important .	1
sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .	1
neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings .	1
for my first i had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky .	0
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! .	1
and supply those stupid white headphones .	0
however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experience mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .	0
there seem to be fewer collisions and dropped packets as i read from the router logs than with my old dlink router .	1
the cons , at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth .	0
this simple nuance was too much for nokia , and they still refuse to acknowledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free .	0
this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .	0
2 ) phone is awfully slow .	0
not a killer problem , but not well done , either .	0
the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .	1
the player feels very delicate , as if i'm holding an actual hard drive .	0
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it won't take up space on your pc hard drive .	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --	0
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .	1
i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .	1
this doesn't affect standard mp3 files - just subscription wma files .	0
i'm currently using a sony vaio s-150 ( which i bought at the end of this past august ) , and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact , i 've taken to just hibernating , rather than shutting down completely .	0
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .	0
with accessories , you can make the ipod into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster .	1
i thought given all the " 10 " reviews about this camera that i would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey .	0
the only free help you get is in renewing your subscription ! .	1
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .	1
poor visibility on the keys .	0
over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level ! .	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .	1
b . fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2 . 4 hz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .	1
the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also .	1
overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast . the capacity in the 20 gb is more than i think most people would ever need and , for the price , i highly recommend it .	1
i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .	1
i'm not overly fond of green but when i used this hitachi m12v it turns out that now i'm very fond of it .	1
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening ! .	1
the touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want .	0
they last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start .	0
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .	0
the creative zen micro , at first glance , is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers .	1
they really are awfully small .	0
the instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually .	0
it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .	1
yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet .	0
2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .	0
this camera is great if you 're used to a high-end slr .	1
too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time .	0
i downloaded this set from norton , and within minutes my internet connection failed and my pc was almost dead due to registry problems from the download .	0
speed is not a problem .	1
) one outstanding positive feature is the battery . it holds a charge for a long time , longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup .	1
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .	1
i had a lot of problems setting it up , since the software given along with it is buggy .	0
then , my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone .	0
the controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed	1
- the software that came with it was tough to load .	0
combine this with the excellent price we got in the gold box , and i'm really happy .	1
not so nice things : - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing ( outside of a table ) - the 1/4 " chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping	0
